## metakg-assertions-of-oppositeness.tsv
The `metakg-assertions-of-oppositeness.tsv` file in this folder contains pairs of subject-predicate-object assertions mined from the MetaKG that share the same subject and object but use predicates that are opposite in nature. The file is generated/updated when the [metakg-assertions-of-oppositeness](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/opposites#cataloging-assertions-of-oppositeness-from-the-metakg) container is run. File format is tab-delimited:


| subject  | object | predicate1 | predicate2 | TEAM_NAME\|API_NAME pairs that serve predicate1 | TEAM_NAME\|API_NAME pairs that serve predicate2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
