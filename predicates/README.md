This list is an early attempt at a conservative list of Biolink slot pairs that each bear some degree of oppositeness. As for provenance, an initial list was compiled by Lindsey Kvarfordt and posted to [biolink-model GitHub issue #657](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/issues/657). This list was reviewed, edited, and added to by Mike Bada and posted on the same GitHub issue page. Note that this list includes not only Biolink predicates but also a small number of node and edge properties.
